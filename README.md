# Web Design Final Project

This project is a multi-page website for a PR Agency, made for the Fall 2025 Web Design course. I expanded my midterm project from a single page into a full site with four pages.

## Pages

The site now has these pages:

- index.html - main homepage with hero, about preview, services preview
- about.html - company story and values
- services.html - detailed info about each service
- contact.html - contact form and info cards

## What I Did

For HTML, I kept using semantic tags like header, nav, section, footer on all pages. Every page has the same nav bar so users can move between pages easily.

For CSS, I used Flexbox for the nav bar and Grid for the services boxes and values boxes. The services section shows 3 columns on desktop.

I added responsive design with media queries:

- Under 768px (phones): everything goes to 1 column
- 768px to 1024px (tablets): services and values show 2 columns
- Above 1024px (desktop): full 3 column layout

I also added hover effects on buttons and cards.

The project has 4 HTML files, 1 CSS file, and an assets folder with the background image.
