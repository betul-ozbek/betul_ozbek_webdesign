# Web Design Midterm Project

This project is a homepage design for a PR Agency, created for the Fall 2024-2025 Web Design course. The goal was to build a clean, responsive, and single-page website using only HTML5 and CSS3.
    
For the design approach, I focused on writing semantic HTML code (using header, nav, section tags) to ensure a proper document structure. I used Flexbox for the navigation bar to align the logo and links, and CSS Grid for the "Services" section to create an equal three-column layout. The site is fully responsive; I added media queries so that the layout adjusts to a single column on mobile devices. I also used standard system fonts like Arial to keep the design simple and fast-loading.

The project folder includes the index.html file, the style.css file for styling, and an assets folder containing the background image. You can view the website by simply opening the index.html file in any browser.
